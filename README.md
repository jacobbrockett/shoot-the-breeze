## Description
Shoot the Breeze is a 2D duck hunting game with an emphasis on power ups and
unique enemies / targets. The player will play through 3 levels, each with a unique
twist added: Level 1 is a simple duck hunting game, Level 2 adds mosquitos you
must blast to avoid losing health, and Level 3 adds diving ducks. These diving
ducks will dive at you to deal damage if you miss, so make sure you are on target!
If youâ€™re not ready, go shoot the breeze!

## Controls
Move your cursor to aim, space bar to fire the gun, R to reload, Enter/Return to
cycle through instructions (when present).
